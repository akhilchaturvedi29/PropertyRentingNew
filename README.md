# Property Listing  Backend API

This repository contains the backend API for a property Resting application. It handles property listings, user authentication, search, recommendations, favorites, and CSV data import.

## Technologies Used

*   Node.js
*   Express.js
*   MongoDB (using Mongoose)
*   Redis
*   TypeScript
*   Multer (for file uploads)
*   JWT (for authentication)
*   render (fro deployement)

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd propertylending
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following variables:

    ```env
    PORT=5000
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
    ```
    Replace the placeholder values with your actual MongoDB connection string, a strong JWT secret, and your Redis URL.

4.  **Start MongoDB and Redis servers:**

    Ensure your MongoDB and Redis server instances are running.

## Running the Application
